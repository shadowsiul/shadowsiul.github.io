          <li>This guide does NOT require a Wifi connection on your Wii.</li>
          <li>An SD card formatted to FAT32 required (best results are with SD cards, SDHC cards will only work on System Menu's 4.0 or above).</li>
          <li>If you get errors during any of the steps reformat your SD card as FAT or FAT32</li>
          <li>Turn off WiiConnect24 and take out all gamecube memory cards/controllers when modding the Wii (unless instructed otherwise).</li>
          <li>If your Wii ever freezes, hold the power button on the Wii for 5 seconds to power it off then try again.</li>
          <li>Don’t ever accept a new Nintendo update without first googling to see if it’s safe. The last update (to 4.3) was released in late June 2010. If you accept an official Nintendo update after modding the Wii, you may lose some or all of your modifications.</li>
          <li>Never uninstall a system menu or IOS.</li>
          <li>Do not install untested WADs/themes without Bootmii or Priiloader installed.</li>
          <li>This custom guide is great start, but Wii modding is always evolving. Check for updates online, and remember, google is your friend.</li>

          <ol>     <!----------------Start of hacking steps listings. This must be here for the hacking guide------------>
            <font size="5"><li>Installing The Homebrew Channel (HBC) and Bootmii</li></font><br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> if this Wii was previously modified, and it has either the HBC, BootMii as Boot2, or a Forwarder Channel installed, you can use that instead of an exploit.<br>
            <br>
            If using BootMii as Boot2 to install the HBC, turn on your Wii with the SD Card inserted and BootMii will load. Go To the SD menu and load bootmini.elf. This will load the Hackmii Installer allowing you to reinstall the HBC.<br>
            <br>
            If using a Forwarder Channel, just save the boot.elf/dol from the app you want to load (ie. SD:\apps\hackmii_installer\boot.elf or SD:\apps\MMM\boot.dol) to the location used by your <u>specific</u> Forwarder Channel (ie. SD:\apps\usbloader\boot.dol). Then start the channel and the Hackmii Installer will load allowing you to reinstall the HBC. Note, if your forwarder channel only loads dol's and not elf's, launch MMM's boot.dol, then use its "App Manager" to load the Hackmii Installer.<br>
            <br>

              Requirements: an SD or SDHC card<br>
              Go to the "Messageboard" on your Wii and navigate to Yesterday. Click on the envelope with the pink Bomb icon.<br>
              <!-----------------------Hackmii installer below----------------------------------->
              <br>
              <A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('http://www.youtube.com/embed/1xVL8usKMoU?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="http://expresstek.org/xflak/files/gifs/HackMii.gif" border="0"/></a><br>
                This runs the Hackmii Installer. Use the installer to install the Homebrew Channel (HBC) and Bootmii as IOS and Bootmii as Boot2 (if possible).<br>
                <b>Note:</b> If you get a "no vulnerable IOS" error message, run ModMii again and this time select the "Hackmii Solutions" option and follow the new instructions before continuing this guide.<br>
                <br>
                <!--------------------------hackmii installer above-------------------------------->
                <!------------------------------Nand backup section below-------------------------->
                <font size="5"><li>Making a NAND backup</li></font><br>
                <A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('http://www.youtube.com/embed/0u_Xgq-MfGw?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="http://expresstek.org/xflak/files/gifs/NANDBackup.gif" border="0"/></a><br>
                  While inside the Homebrew Channel, load BootMii by pressing home and clicking Launch Bootmii.<br>
                  Press the power button on the Wii 3 times to get to the last option, then press the reset button (you can also navigate with a Gamecube controller).<br>
                  Press reset to choose the first option, then follow the directions on the screen to make your NAND backup (bad blocks are no problem).<br>
                  Backup the Bootmii folder, nand.bin, and keys.bin elsewhere and erase from the SD card (or rename it). You'll need these in case of emergencies, so don't lose them.<br>
                  Go back to The Homebrew Channel.<br>
                  <b>Note:</b> if Bootmii was installed as boot2, then it will show up as soon as the Wii is turned on AS LONG AS it finds the bootmii folder (mentioned above) on the root of the SD card.<br>
                  <br>
                  <!------------------------------Nand backup section above-------------------------->
                  <!----------------------------Install IOS236 below--------------------------------->
                  <font size="5"><li>Install a patched IOS236</li></font><br>
                  <br>
                  Start the Homebrew Channel.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>VERY IMPORTANT!</b><br>
                  In the Homebrew channel, if you do not have a working internet connection already set up, you will see an icon flashing in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating its inability to initialize the network. You should wait for the icon to stop flashing OR let it flash for 30-60 seconds before proceeding otherwise these apps may error shortly after being launched. If you encounter this harmless error, power off the Wii and repeat this step from the beginning. To increase your chances of success, add a working internet connection to your Wii via the official Wii Settings Menu, but be sure to say "No" when asked to perform an update.<br>
                  <br>
                  You only need to perform ONE of the below methods.<br>
                  Once either method successfully installs IOS236, you can move onto the next step.<br>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Method A: Using IOS236 Installer</b></li><br>
                    <A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('http://www.youtube.com/embed/Asq6_bh7Yko?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="http://expresstek.org/xflak/files/gifs/IOS236Installer.gif" border="0"/></a><br>
                      After waiting 30-60 seconds for the HBC to attempt to initialize the network, launch "IOS236 Installer v5 MOD".<br>
                      <b>Note:</b> This app must be launched using HBC v1.0.7 or higher in order to work properly.<br>
                      It should say "IOS236 installation is complete!" and return to The Homebrew Channel.<br>
                      <br>
                      If you experience errors, keep trying and it should eventually work.<br>
                      If you continue to experience errors you can try using Simple IOS Patcher instead.<br>
                      <br>

                      <li><b>Method B: Using Simple IOS Patcher</b></li><br>
                      <A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('http://www.youtube.com/embed/fKJVmp4WeCA?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="http://expresstek.org/xflak/files/gifs/SimpleIOSPatcher.gif" border="0"/></a><br>
                        After waiting 30-60 seconds for the HBC to attempt to initialize the network, launch "Simple IOS Patcher".<br>
                        <b>Note:</b> This app must be launched using HBC v1.0.7 or higher in order to work properly.<br>
                        Choose "IOS36" (already selected by default) and push A, then select "Install IOS to slot" and choose 236. Select "Install patched IOS36" leaving the 4 patches set to "yes" and press A, then choose "Load IOS from SD card". Confirm your choice with the A button and, when prompted, push A to continue the installation. When the installation is finished press the B button to exit the Main Menu.<br>
                        <br>
                        If you experience errors, keep trying and it should eventually work.<br>
                        If you continue to experience errors you can try using IOS236 Installer instead.
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                      <!----------------------------Install IOS236 above--------------------------------->
                      <!---------------------------Install Priiloader below------------------------------>
                      <font size="5"><li>Install Priiloader</li></font><br>
                      <A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('http://www.youtube.com/embed/If1XSrEVhfY?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="http://expresstek.org/xflak/files/gifs/Priiloader.gif" border="0"/></a><br>
                        Launch "Priiloader 236 Mod" via the Homebrew Channel<br>
                        After the Priiloader Installer loads, press + to install it.<br>
                        After successfully installing Priiloader, access it by powering off the Wii, then powering it back on while holding reset until you see the Priiloader menu.<br>
                        You should install some system menu hacks now (by going to System Menu hacks option).<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>RECOMMENDED HACKS</b>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Block Disc Updates</li>
                          <li>Block Online Updates</li>
                          <li>Replace Health Screen</li>
                          <li>Move Disc Channel</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        The priiloader menu is white by default, you can change it to black in the Priiloader settings if you prefer.<br>
                        <br>
                        One of the special functions of Priiloader is that it can autoboot any app/file instead of the system menu. Some apps (like crazyIntro) can't be used without it.<br>
                        For details on how to do so, visit <a href="http://www.sites.google.com/site/completesg/system-hacks/priiloader" target="_blank">www.sites.google.com/site/completesg/system-hacks/priiloader</a><br>
                        <br>
                        <!---------------------------Install Priiloader above------------------------------>
                        <!-------------------------Installing WADs section below--------------------------->
                        <font size="5"><li>Install WADs</li></font><br>
                        <A href="" onClick="popup = window.open('http://www.youtube.com/embed/_OUlkjGzqE4?rel=0', 'PopupPage', 'height=360,width=480,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes'); return false" target="_blank"><img src="http://expresstek.org/xflak/files/gifs/WADs.gif" border="0"/></a><br>
                          Load Multi-Mod Manager (MMM) via the HomeBrew Channel.<br>
                          If IOS236 is not already loaded, select "Load another IOS", then select IOS236<br>

                          <b>Note:</b> If this step fails with error -ret 2011 or other, you may need to retry patching IOS236. If the Wii was previously softmodded, you can try loading cIOS250 (or others like 202,222,223,224,236,249)<br>
                          <br>
                          In Multi-Mod Manager's main menu, go down to select "WAD Manager".<br>
                          Install the following WADs from the WAD folder (this list of WADs is unique to the information you provided ModMii).<br>
                          Be careful not to install any additional WADs that may have been previously saved in this folder (they may be safe, but I cannot say for sure).<br>
                          <br>
                          Mark each of the following WADs for installation by navigating to each WAD and hitting "+"<br>
                          Alternatively, you can hold "+" for 2 seconds to select all the WADs in the folder.<br>
                          After you've marked all the WADs listed below, press 'A' twice to install them.<br>
                          <br>
                          If any files fail to install properly, they will remain marked for installation, so just retry installing those files.<br>
                          <br>
                          <b>Your unique list of WADs to install are as follows:</b>

                            If the HBC is using IOS58 and your HBC is not upside-down, you can skip this step.<br>
                            <br>
                            If the HBC is not using IOS58 or it is upside-down, you should continue with this step to reinstall it.<br>

                              Use the Hackmii Installer to fix/re-install the HBC (using IOS58). Once you've successfully reinstalled the HBC, you can move onto the next step of the guide.<br>
                              If the HBC is failing to load the HackMii_Installer (just blackscreens), instead launch the Hackmii Installer using the method described in the first Step.<br>

                            <!----------------------------After Modding section below----------------------------->
                            <font size="6"><li><a name="Done">After modding your Wii</a></li></font><br>
                            After you are done modding your Wii, you can optionally delete any unnecesarry files by using ModMii's "File Cleanup" Feature.<br><br>

                            If you used Bannerbomb and choose not to use the File Cleanup feature, in order to avoid having your Wii freeze when accessing the SD Card Menu, you should delete the "aktn" folder where bannerbomb is saved (SD:\private\wii\title\aktn), or rename the entire "private" folder.<br><br>

                            At this point you're practically done.<br>
                            Now you should be downloading the latest homebrew applications and setting them up on your SD Card (or FAT32 USB Hard Drive) so they can be launched via the HBC.<br>
                            <br>
                            For playing your backups off a USB hard drive, run the USB-Loader Setup feature from ModMii's Main Menu.<br>
                            <br>
                            For downloading applications, you should:<br>
                            <ul><li>Check out ModMii's batch download pages as it has many popular apps available for download.</li>
                              <li>Download <a href="http://www.sites.google.com/site/completesg/how-to-use/hbb" target="_blank">Homebrew Browser</a> via ModMii to get many popular apps, but this is an online only Wii application.</li>
                              <li>For those without internet on their Wii, check out this list of <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/List_of_all_homebrew" target="_blank">Homebrew applications.</a></li></ul>
                              Another great resource is <a href="http://webrewwii.blogspot.com" target="_blank">webrewwii.blogspot.com</a><br><br>

                              After getting whatever apps you want, you should get a boot.dol file and possibly a icon.png and meta.xml.<br>
                              For HBC to read your SD/USB correctly, your card must be structured SD:/apps/application name/boot.dol<br>
                              If you have a *.dol not named boot.dol, rename it boot.dol, otherwise it will not be recognized by the HBC.<br>
                              (optional: the icon.png and meta.xml should be saved in the same place as the boot.dol)<br>
                              <br>

                              ModMii was written entirely by me, XFlak; however, without the help of many other very talented people ModMii would not exist.<br>
                              Some people have contributed supporting files or programs, others have shared their knowledge, some have provided ideas and others have given their time.<br>

                                      Thanks to Team Twiizers for creating the revolutionary HackMii Installer. Without their hard work, the Wii might never have been unlocked. Many Team Twiizer Members went on to join Team Fail Overflow; a team that played a vital role in unlocking the PS3.<br><br>

                                      I especially want to thank Bushing, who gave ModMii his blessing to download and use the HackMii Installer.</li><br>

                                      <li><b><font size="4">Giantpune</font></b><br>
                                        Giantpune is a legend in the Wii Scene and I consider him to be a good friend of mine. He created many exploits, including the Smash Stack exploit for PAL and KOR Wii's (which is still the only method to fix 003 bricked Wii's), the Channel Forwarder dol, USB Loader GX, and many other computer programs to repair or virginize Wii's.<br><br>

                                        He's contributed code to more projects than I even know about, so its impossible for me to truly convey his impact on the scene. He even took the time to explain a few things to me about cIOSs when ModMii was in its early stages and still known as NUS Auto Downloader.</li><br>


                                        <li><b><font size="4">Crediar, Daco Taco and Phpgeek</font></b><br>
                                          The above people all had a hand in creating Priiloader. This was another revolutionary tool mainly because it was the first to offer some level of protection to newer Wii's that were unable to install BootMii at boot2. Crediar developed the original preloader as well as s/uneek, NMM, DML, etc.</li><br>

                                          <li><b><font size="4">Comex</font></b><br>
                                            In addition to being a member of Team Twiizers and contributing to the HackMii Installer, Comex created the heavily utilized bannerbomb exploit. This exploit is what allows Wii's on firmwares 3.0-4.2 to be softmodded with only an SD Card instead of needing one of a few specific Wii Games.</li><br>


                                            <li><b><font size="4">Waninkoko</font></b><br>
                                              Waninkoko was the first to publicly release a cIOS and other excellent apps like WAD manager, Save Game Manager, USB loader, etc. I also want to thank him for giving ModMii permission to recreate his cIOSs in WAD form.<br><br>

                                              <li><b><font size="4">Hermes</font></b><br>
                                                Hermes is well known for his cIOS 222/223/224 and for his usbloader "uloader". For a time his cIOSs were the only ones to work with RockBand type games and they are still highly utilized today.</li><br>

                                                  These developers worked together to modify Waninkoko's rev21 cIOS and created a new "d2x" cIOS. This cIOS is currently considered the ultimate cIOS because it corrected many bugs and added features that were previously thought to be impossible (ie. Support for IOS Reloading Games). WiiPower was also heavily influential in achieving IOS Reload Support.</li><br>

                                                        cwstjdenobs is one of the few people I've encountered in the Wii scene that I would love to treat to a beer. He was always very supportive of me and encouraged me to ask him as many questions as I'd like. He is probably most well known for YAWMM (Yet Another Wad Manager Mod) which was the first Wad Manager to add brick protection by restricting users from making silly mistakes like uninstalling or stubbing a crucial file. He's also made and modified apps specifically for ModMii. For example, he modified WadMii so it doesn't timestamp WADs and he also made a setting.txt builder for ModMii's NAND builder.</li><br>

                                                          Leathl is another awesome developer who supported me before I became well known by expanding upon his apps to further support ModMii. Leathl has created many Wii apps including ShowMiiWads, CustomizeMii, libwiisharp, patchios, nusfilegrabber, etc. Despite his recent inactivity, his apps are still highly used today... just goes to show you that quality work never gets old. I also want to thank RetroHead for him Mod of ShowMiiWads which ModMii uses to build emulated nands without requiring any input from the user. libwiisharp.dll is based on wii.py, the wii.py devs are Megazig, Omega, Xuzz, SquidMan, Matt_P and The Lemon Man. Also thanks to Daeken for writing Struct.py and marcan for his LZ77 code.</li><br>

ModMii will always construct the latest version of s\uneek available on his sneeky compiler google code webpage. This means he has total control over what version of s\uneek ModMii will construct. He also created modifications of Leathl's libwiisharp.dll and patchios.exe to further support ModMii. Additionally, he's modified other apps like JoyFlow, JoyLoader GX, JoyLoader CFG, etc. On top of all that, he's an all around awesome person and I'm proud to be on his friends list.</li><br>

He also modified WiiGators cMIOS and created what is today considered the ultimate cMIOS. Furthermore he's contributed code to many other popular usb-loaders and had a hand in adding IOS Reloading support to the d2x cIOSs.</li><br>

It's very challenging to get special characters to display correctly in a cmd window, not to mention keeping everything formatted properly. But probably the most difficult part of translating ModMii is keeping up with the updates. If you use a translated version of ModMii, I encourage you to thank your translator because it truly is a LOT of work to do.<br><br>

Within 1.5 weeks since our initial conversation we were able to collaborate and bring the idea to life in time to release it for Christmas. Working with him on this was a truly rewarding and fun experience. DeadlyFoez also single-handedly built ModMii.comuf.com (formerly ModMii.zzl.org) which has become the official ModMii website.<br><br>

He's always getting me into trouble but his friendship is worth every fiasco! It's unreal how he became one of my best friends. Just goes to show you not everyone you meet online is totally crazy; in his case... just a little crazy. But seriously, thanks to DeadlyFoez for always being there for me to bounce ModMii ideas off of, for hosting the first two Team Your Mom meetings and for introducing me to his awesome family and friends. There's no one else I'd rather geek out with and I'll always have your back.</li><br>
